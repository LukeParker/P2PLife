# P2PLife
Website & community to promote true P2P applications

The goal of this project is to create a review-type website, similar to PortableApps.com, but instead of apps that are merely portable, these apps are fully decentralized via P2P, capable of forming a full network with the downloads listed on the site and nothing else. 

There will be NO altcoin-only projects allowed. Each project must be Bitcoin-using or have no associated tokens at all.

Eventually there could even be a type of unified runtime environment, or launcher like PortableApps has as well… A single environment to launch all user-selected P2P apps from or within, together. I’ll have to get some volunteers to code such a thing but I can handle the website myself.

Note: This project will run on donations alone, for my upkeep over time, but still be fully open source. 


# THE RULES
All apps listed are carefully vetted to ensure they follows certain Rules: 

*I. Uncensorable:* All must be Fully P2P, meaning no federations, masternodes, central coordinators nor central escrow. Every node runs the same software as every other node on the network.

*II. Trustworthy:* Fully Open Source, which means every line of the code of every node is open to all to see. “Without Open Source development, it’s only a matter of time until it’s no longer decentralized.”

*III. Permissionless:* If there are no Iranians, Venezuelans, and North Koreans using this software than it is a failure. Projects must be available for download through TOR and VPNs, making it as widely available as possible.  

*IV. Free-Speech aligned:* No one in the app can unilaterally censor the speech of anyone else. Voting and paying for placement is fine, as long as it’s a fair market. Moderation powers can not be given to anyone, not even to a democratically-voted group of users. A preferred alternative is Gab’s style of self-curation.   

*V. Bitcoin-Aligned:* Unfortunately we have to fight off an infestation of altcoins trying to compete with bitcoin by attaching themselves to a P2P project that bitcoin could do just as well. The devs that issue these tokens get rich, typically from holding onto some of the issuance. (Test: Could a market using bitcoin fulfill the same function in that project?) So any token attached to a P2P project that is required for the use of that project is henceforth a SCAM. Exceptions can be made if the token isn’t required and didn’t make the developers money. Example: Bisq token
